# Brain_waves_analysis

The brain waves play a crucial role in sending signals to different parts of the body. Analyzing this data helps scientists uncover the intricacies and complexities of the human brain and provide solutions to help people with brain-related disorders. 
We’ll discuss brain waves and ways to use Python to analyze this data.

# What are Brain Waves?

Brain waves are the electrical pulses used by neurons to communicate with each other. The neurons use electrical impulses to send signals about different human emotions and behaviors.
The frequency of each brain wave is different, depending on the emotion felt and displayed by the person. Measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second, we have slow and fast brain waves released by the neurons. The brain waves are given individual names to differentiate one from another based on the frequency.

# Types of Brain Waves

There are five types of brain waves, with delta being the slowest and gamma being the fastest. The level of human awareness is determined by the frequency/ speed of the brain waves.
# Delta Brain Waves
As the slowest of all, these high amplitude brain waves have a frequency of 1 to 3 Hz and are experienced by humans when they are asleep.
# Theta Brain Waves

The Theta waves have a frequency range of 4 to 7 Hz and are found when a person is in a dreamy state. When the waves are close to the lower end, they represent the state when a person hovers between sleep and consciousness. It’s also known as the twilight state. Theta waves, in general, signify that mental inefficiency or that the person is either too relaxed or blanked out (zoned out) at that moment.
# Alpha Brain Waves

The alpha brain waves have a frequency range of 8 to 12 Hz. These are larger and slower, representing a relaxed or calm state of mind for a person ready to get into action if the need arises. The alpha brain waves are generated when someone feels peaceful after closing their eyes and picturing something they like.
# Beta Brain Waves

Beta brain waves are faster and smaller, with a frequency range of 13 to 38 Hz. These waves imply that the person is focused on something. They signify alertness, where the person is in their senses and displays all signs of concentration and mental activity.
# Gamma Brain Waves

Gamma brain waves are the fastest ones, with a frequency range of 38 to 42 Hz. These are subtle compared to the other brain waves and work on the consciousness and perception of the person. The waves occur when a person is highly alert and can feel every minute change in their surroundings.

In this repo, I have tried to analyse the brain waves data using MNE library 
# In Python
To run this library, please follow the instructions given below:
1. Install Python 3.6 or higher versions recommended
2. Install the requirement.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt command in your terminal.
3. Run the brain_waves_analysis.py file in terminal

# To run this library on Google Colab
1. Download the brain_waves_analysis.ipybnb file
2. Import and run each cell of file in google colab
